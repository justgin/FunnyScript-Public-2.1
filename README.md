# FunnyScripts
 **A simple python script that combines many utilities interacting with JSON format of GDBot Macros.**

 This scripts can contain errors and it is WIP application. It is also probably will become useless when Geometry Dash 2.2 come out
## **Quick Start**
Dependencies:
- Only [Python 3.5+](https://www.python.org/) is required. Everything else is pre-installed in Python

```console
git clone https://github.com/GinProjects/FunnyScript-Public-2.1.git
```

**This was only tested on Windows.**

There is 2 versions of the same file. Translated to Russian Language, and original (English Language):

**Russian Version:**
```console
python ru.py help
```

**Original Version:**
```console
python onefile.py help
```

## Geometry Dash

**This code does not interact with the Geometry Dash the game it is just changes the macros of GD-BOTs in JSON format.**

## Tests

To check if everything works as intented you can run [test.py](/tests/test.py). To get the usage of test, just execute while being in [tests](/tests/) directory:
```console
python ./test.py help
```

And if yoy want to check every pre-made test case you can run every pre-made test case using:
```console
python ./test.py checkfolder .
```
### Note: Tests.py wasn't tested on any Python version other than 3.11 and it would not work in Python 3.5

Also the source code of tests is kinda bad, but it does even more than this project could ever need

## Obfuscation

**Huge thanks to [ComradeBypass](https://github.com/ComradeBypass) for creating [Comfuscate](https://github.com/ComradeBypass/Comfuscate), the obfuscator that i used to obfuscate the code.**

If this script will become useless i will probably publish the original of this repo with all the commits, changes and source code
